Congruence is the language for modular arithmetic. It was introduced by Gauss in the 19th century in his book '_Disquisitiones Arithmeticae_'. In this blog post, I will provide a detailed explanation of the idea of congruences and some of the most important theorems about congruences.   

#### **Definition**
Let a,b be two integers. a is congruent to b **relative to** _m_, written: $$ a \equiv b \pmod m $$ if and only if $$ m \mid (a-b)$$
